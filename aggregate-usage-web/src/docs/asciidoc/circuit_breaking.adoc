== Circuit Breaking

In the service we also implemented circuit breaking functionality from Hystrix. FEZ Microservices - Netflix's Hystrix

The method that retrieves the Aggregate Usage from TIP is wrapped in a Hystrix command. A fallback method is implemented and it provides some extra logging which enables us to see if the circuit breaker is open. The circuit breaker will trip when there are 5 faulty requests (404 excluded) in a rolling time frame of 15 seconds.

In the spring boot health endpoint there's some additional information added about the status of the circuitbreaker. See the example below:
